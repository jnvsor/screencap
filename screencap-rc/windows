# * FFmpeg - Download from zeranoe: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
# * screen-capture-recorder dshow device:

#   What a horrible repo name...
# * Bash - all bashes should work - Since I'm hosted on github I'll assume you
#   have git for windows installed and you use git bash (I don't know how cgywin
#   maps it's drives, and quite frankly I don't want to use windows and find out)
