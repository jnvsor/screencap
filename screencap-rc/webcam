# Name your video streams

# NOTE:
# FFmpeg bug: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/3192
# Causes stuttering when webcam is filtered along with x11grab
# Workaround below (Don't worry if it's daunting, this whole section will be
# removed once the FFmpeg bug is fixed)

# Null the original x11grab input
cap_in=( null )

# Add new x11grab input
video_in+=( -f x11grab -framerate 30 -s hd1080 -i :0.0 )
video_name+=( secondgrab )

# We have to manually reapply any scales we wanted, $cap_scale won't work
video_filter="[secondgrab]scale=w=-1:h=720[cap];"

# Map as if nothing's wrong so as not to break sub configs
video_map=( webcam )
cap_map=( cap )

# This workaround isn't perfect - it's less performant than if the bug didn't
# exist, and the framerate, capture size etc are hard coded.
# That said, the workaround makes it go from 17fps to 30fps
